# WGU C482
This inventory management application is my project for the Software 1 course at WGU. The application allows users to create and manage a static inventory of parts and products. 

## Overview
#### Scenario
"You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program."
